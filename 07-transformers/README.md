## Transformers and Large Language Models

> among the reasons I use large pre-trained language models sparingly in my computer-generated poetry practice is that being able to know whose voices I'm speaking with is... actually important, as is being understanding how the output came to have its shape - [@aparrish](https://twitter.com/aparrish/), [full thread](https://twitter.com/aparrish/status/1286808606466244608)
